# Total Time Spent 0hr

# June 28th: Researching parts, weight, and costs

Today is the start of the next bot, today will mainly consist of making a basic BOM, researching how to connect everything, and how to start designing the pcb for it. We also decided on the name of the bot... unscheduled dissasembly. Dylan worked on making the BOM and looked into what would need to be done to make the pcb. Luke sat on call with dylan and helped out with the BOM. After being on call for one hour we came up with the tenative BOM.

With this BOM we have two 3536 drone motors as our main drive motors and two 90a esc's that Dylan found a good deal on. We also decieded on running the bot on a 3500 mah 4s battery, on lukes suggestion we are going to run carbon fiber for top and bottom plates with ar500 or s7 tool steel teeth somehow screws into a tpu body.
