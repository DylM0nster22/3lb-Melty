# June 28th: Researching parts, weight, and costs

Today is the start of the next bot, today will mainly consist of making a basic BOM, researching how to connect everything, and how to start designing the pcb for it. We also decided on the name of the bot... unscheduled dissasembly. Dylan worked on making the BOM and looked into what would need to be done to make the pcb. Luke sat on call with dylan and helped out with the BOM.
